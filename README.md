# Problem Statement:

- "Specialists analyze ADHD in youngsters after a kid has shown at least six explicit indications of distractedness or hyperactivity consistently for over a half year in no less than two settings. The specialist will look at how a youngster's conduct contrasts and that of different kids a similar age. There is no particular or conclusive test for ADHD. All things being equal, diagnosing is a cycle that makes a few strides and includes assembling a tonne of data from numerous sources. You, your youngster, your kid's school, and different parental figures ought to be associated with surveying your kid's conduct. A specialist will likewise ask what indications your youngster has, how quite a while in the past those manifestations began, and what the conduct means for your kid and the remainder of your family. Each classroom has understudies who observe learning somewhat more testing than others. Yet, as far as some might be concerned, the battle reaches out past the essential understanding of what's being educated. Understudies adapting to dyslexia might track down basic retention or recite without holding back to be troublesome, or even unimaginable. Single-step bearings that aren't excessively intricate are most straightforward for understudies with dyslexia to follow. Convoluted directions, with numerous memorable means and followings, are difficult for dyslexic understudies to recall and finish with. Be brief and consistently give composed guidelines that can be utilized as a kind of perspective. A student having diseases like Dyslexia, Dyscalculia, Dysgraphia, Dyspraxia, Autism, or ADHD might show very mild symptoms early on and hence it makes it difficult for a proper diagnosis. Current physiological and psychiatric tests do not provide an accurate diagnosis at an early age. There are not many digital means to increase the learning quotient of such students.This project aims to propose a platform that can harness digital means to detect diseases like Dyslexia, Dyscalculia, Dysgraphia, Dyspraxia, Autism, or ADHD when the symptoms are mild and easier to manage. It also aims to provide a digital means to help the kids on the specially skilled spectrum to match with their counterparts."

# Flow:

-  Initially, the parents will be filling a questionnaire regarding the general behaviour of
their child and his/her academic skills. This is for the counsellor to have a better
understanding of the child.   
- All students will be appearing for a diagnostic test which includes basic reading,
listening and writing questions of age-appropriate level (Grade 3/Grade 4). Questions
will be such that they help us to identify symptoms for the below mentioned LDs in a
child. While appearing for the test, a supervisor will always be present to monitor the
behaviour of child during the test. It is mandatory for each student to appear for all 4
diagnostic tests
<br>
For diagnosis of each of the L.D., following methods will be used:
<br><br>
A. Dyslexia – A set of words, phrases, sentences and paragraphs from the child’s
curriculum would be shown to them on screen and they have to read it out
loud. The words spoken by the student and original given text will be recorded,
compared and the result will be stored in database.
<br><br>
 B. Dyscalculia – Simple Math questions of – basic math operations, less than,
greater than, which number is bigger and which is smaller and other topics from child’s
curriculum will be shown on the screen and the students have to answer them.
<br><br>
C. Dysgraphia –
<br>
Section 1: An activity sheet(printed) will be given to the students. The sheet
will have various types of questions like – tracing the dotted shapes, drawing
the shown shapes, copying short paragraphs, answering simple questions in one
sentence.
<br>
Section 2: Student will listen to audio (words/sentences) and will have to write
it down on the same sheet. After the completion of activity sheet, the sheet will
be uploaded on the application by the supervisor.
<br><br>
D. ADHD –
<br>
Section 1: A short video story/picture will be shown to the student and the
student has to observe it. After a while, the story/picture will disappear from
the screen and the student will be asked simple questions related to it.
<br>
Section 2: A memory flip card game for example: 2x2, 3x3, 4x4 will be given
and student has to complete it. The time taken to complete the game will be
noted down. 

- The responses of Parents Questionnaire, the final answers of all the tests given by the
student and the feedback of the supervisor as to how did the child behaved during the
test will be analysed and the students scoring below a certain threshold value will be
shortlisted. All responses of such students will be shown to the school counsellor
appointed to the child. Based on counsellor’s recommendation, final call of whether
the student has a particular Learning Disability or not will be taken.  

- If the student is having a LD, the counsellor can suggest some relevant activities
(activities/questions similar to diagnosis test, just with appropriate level of difficulty)
which will help in the remediation of the child. The activities when given, should be
completed and the scores of the child will be monitored again.
